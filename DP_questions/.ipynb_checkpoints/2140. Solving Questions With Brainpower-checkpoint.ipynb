    "# 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower\n",
    "You are given a **0-indexed 2D** integer array questions where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question `i` will earn you points `i` points but you will be unable to solve each of the next brainpower `i` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given questions = `[[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:\n",
    "If question 0 is solved, you will earn 3 points but you will be unable to solve questions 1 and 2.\n",
    "If instead, question 0 is skipped and question 1 is solved, you will earn 4 points but you will be unable to solve questions 2 and 3.\n",
    "Return the maximum points you can earn for the exam.\n",

    "**Explanation:** The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.\n",
    "- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions\n",
    "- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2\n",
    "- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points\n",
    "Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.\n",
